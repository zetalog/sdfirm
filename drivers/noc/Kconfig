	help
	  For number of CAIs (normally equivalent to the number of CPU
	  cores) that is less than 32, it is possible to configure them
	  all at once using masks. By doing this, reconfiguration of NoC
	  is allowed.

	help
	  By default, ARM reference driver uses range based rather than
	  hashed SAM configuration. However, this driver uses hashed SAM
	  unless this option is enabled.

	help
	  According to silicon verification, CXRA needn't be assigned of
	  an agent ID. However, this is the default behavior according to
	  ARM reference driver.

config CMN600_CML_HA_RAID_RNF_LOCAL
	bool "Enable programming local RN-F agent IDs"
	help
	  According to silicon verification, not only remote RN-F but also
	  local RN-F should be programmed to CMN_cxg_ha_rnf_raid_to_ldid
	  with RNF feild filling with 0.
	  However, ARM reference driver never fills such entries.
