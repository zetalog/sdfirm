	help
	  For number of CAIs (normally equivalent to the number of CPU
	  cores) that is less than 32, it is possible to configure them
	  all at once using masks. By doing this, reconfiguration of NoC
	  is allowed.

	  By default, ARM reference driver uses range based rather than

	help
	  This mode is useful for VIVT platform where SLC is too much to
	  map shared regions. In this way, OCM are always used as locked
	  ways, the locked amount can be determined by the SoC specific
	  settings.

config CMN600_OCM_DDR

	help
	  This mode is useful for bootloaders like UEFI, where DDR driver
	  has not been invoked while the bootloader itself is required to
	  run in the DDR address space.

	  According to silicon verification, not only remote RN-F but also
	  local RN-F should be programmed to CMN_cxg_ha_rnf_raid_to_ldid
	  with RNF feild filling with 0.
	  However, ARM reference driver never fills such entries.

config CMN600_CML_RA_COUNT_ALIGNED
	bool "Enable aligned HNF RAID of local RA count"
	help
	  By default, remote HNF RAID is aligned put at the beginning of
	  the RAID array. Enabling this option can help to avoid conflict
	  that may occur when the local RNI count is less than the local
	  RNF count.
	  If unsure, say 'N'.
